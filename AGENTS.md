# MUSU Landing Page Rules

Goal: a single "Coming Soon" landing page for musuwrap.com. Static HTML/CSS only.

Tone: poetic, minimal, calm, understated. No marketing hype, no exclamation marks.
Design: generous whitespace, museum-like, black/near-black text, no gradients, no clutter.
Content: short lines. Include: MUSU, 風呂敷, "Wrap once. Gift twice.", "Launching soon."
Tech constraints:
- No frameworks.
- No build step.
- No external fonts.
- Must be accessible (semantic HTML, good contrast).
Deliverables:
- index.html
- styles.css (optional) or embedded CSS
